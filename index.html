          <h2>About Me:</h2>
          
          <p>My name is Ishwar Balliram and was born in the tropical Island of Trinidad located in the Caribbean. Growing up, I helped my dad in his photography business while at the same time learning the art of photography. I live there till the age of 18 and then migrated to the United States to pursue my education. I decided to live in Miami and worked my first job at the American University of the Caribbean located in Coral Gables. While working, I attended school at Miami Dade Community College. I then later transferred to the University of Miami to pursue my education. While living in Miami, I also got involved in Church and became the youth director for a few years. </p>
<p>
I eventually got married in August of 2010 to a wonderful woman and we now have one child, a girl. Her name is Annabelle and our lives are forever changed. My wife is currently 12 weeks pregnant weâ€™re super excited about the newest member of the family that will be born sometime in March of 2016. </p>
<p>
I enjoy spending time with my family and friends. I think that family is the most important unit that helps us keep sane in insane world. As a family we enjoy praying together, visiting relatives, and keeping each other company. 
I am fun to be around though it takes time before am able to open up to anyone. I enjoy life to the fullest and love to go on vacations. I am very excited about my Graduate Studies and look forward to completing the program.
